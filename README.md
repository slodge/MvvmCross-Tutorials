MvxTutorials
============

To build this repo you need to include the MvvmCross binaries from https://github.com/slodge/MvvmCross-Binaries into /Lib/Mvx

* Use MvvmCross-Binaries\VS2012\bin\[Debug|Release] if you are using Visual Studio and are not targeting Xamarin.iOS/Xamarin.Mac.
* Use MvvmCross-Binaries\XS-iOS-Mac\bin\[Debug|Release] if you are using MonoDevelop (Xamarin Studio) or are developing for Xamarin.iOS/Xamarin.Mac.

When setup, you should have an Mvx subfolder here with subfolders of 'Portable' plus one or more specific platforms
